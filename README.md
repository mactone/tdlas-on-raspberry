Building TDLAS application on raspberry

I am trying to build a program to run on raspberry. The program is to drive the TDLAS control box and gathering f2-wms signal through ads1115 AD converter. Then the 2f wms peaks can be analyzed and finally the gas concentration can be obtained. 

##Todos 
- [x] control TDLAS control box by python
- [X] acquiring the data from TDLAS output through ADS1115
- [ ] increase the sampling rate to the top
- [ ] breaking the datas into segaments
- [ ] analyze the peak values of acquired data
- [x] live plot using python programming
